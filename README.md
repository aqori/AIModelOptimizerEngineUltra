# AIModelOptimizerEngineUltra

## Description

A neuroevolutionary AI framework leveraging sparse asynchronous distributed training and hierarchical neural architecture search, optimized for real-time edge inference on resource-constrained devices.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for the AIModelOptimizerEngineUltra software project:
- "Automates hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression",
- "Supports multiobjective optimization for conflicting performance metrics using NSGAII",
- "Provides explainable AI capabilities through modelagnostic saliency mapping",
- "Implements gradientbased optimization with momentum and Nesterov acceleration",
- "Offers realtime model performance monitoring and alerting for concept drift detection",
- "Includes automated model pruning and knowledge distillation for efficient inference",
- "Supports distributed training on heterogeneous GPU and CPU architectures using OpenMPI"
- Let me know if you'd like me to generate more!
